rpeditor is a Python program which reads a .txt file and converts formatting into Mediawiki format. Mostly made for https://gsgwocs.miraheze.org/wiki/Main_Page
Please go into rpeditor for the main code. 

The program has 3 major parts: main, standformatting, and uniqueformatting. 

"main.py" reads from the file and locates the username (Tupper) and message, and calls upon the formatting 



EXPECTED FORMAT

  Please check the given source.txt file for expected format. There should only be a blank line between messages.

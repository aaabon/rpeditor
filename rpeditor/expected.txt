*The leader of P-Squad—Park Doohyun, is currently walking to he K-Squad's office. His footsteps echoes, seemingly louder than it actually is.
He stops at a door with the sign 'K-Squad'. He doesn't hear any sounds coming from behind the door. Too quiet, too somber to his own liking. He knocks, but there's no answers.

"...I'm coming in. Excuse me intrusion."
Seo-Hyuk (Aka Centipede)

seo-hyuk is holding a basically empty bottle of soju and under his eyes are red and puffy as he looks up blearly "...hic you didnt respond to my text" he says bitterly still clearly drunk as he glares at Doohyun "You a hic bad friend"
Seo-hyuk then stands up "why are you in k-team office anyway" his words are slurred as he stomps his foot like a child
